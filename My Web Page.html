<font size="6"><h2 style="color: red;">History:</h2></font>
<font size="4"><h2 style="color: red;">The Straw Hat Pirates are a small but powerful pirate crew that originated from East Blue but have various members from different areas. They are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in Alabasta. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. After the Enies Lobby Arc, they obtain a new ship called the Thousand Sunny. The Straw Hats currently consist of ten members whose combined bounties equal 3,161,000,100 Berries.</h2></font>
<font size="4"><h2 style="color: red;">Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, the first nine members were separated from one another. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other.</h2></font>
<font size="4"><h2 style="color: red;">Following the events of the Dressrosa arc, the crew was also massively expanded; the main crew didn't change, but seven other pirate captains and their respective crews have pledged their allegiance to Luffy, forming the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.</h2></font>
<font size="4"><h2 style="color: red;">Following the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc, Luffy's successful raid against Big Mom, the complete destruction of her castle, and his defeat of her top Commanders was made public knowledge by the journalist "Big News" Morgans. Furthermore, the formation of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet and the addition of a former Warlord to his crew (Jinbe) was also revealed to the masses. For this, Luffy is now considered the Fifth Emperor of the Sea in some circles of the world and the Straw Hats have become unambiguously recognized as one of the strongest pirate crews in the world.</h2></font>
<font size="4"><h2 style="color: red;">After defeating Kaido and the Beast Pirates, the Straw Hat Pirates are now dubbed as the Yonko Crew when Luffy has officially became a Yonko by the Gorosei. Yamato (Kaido's daughter) wanted to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but not yet and needs to wait until she has been officially confirmed as a new member of the crew by the young captain himself, according to Jinbe. Due to Admiral Ryokugyu's invasion however, Yamato decided to stay at Wano to protect it from any invaders. Luffy left a replica of his crew's Jolly Roger to Wano when declared Wano is now his territory under his protection.</h2></font>
